Consider the following PARTIAL data definition. You will note that it only
includes the type comment.  The interpretation and data examples are not
important for this problem -- do NOT add them.

You must complete the @dd-template-rules tag and template function definition.
You are permitted to:

 - simplify cond questions by eliminating UNECESSARY guards, or
 - fully guard.

BUT, if you do simplify you must do so correctly, and all necessary guards must
be in place.

Note that this problem will be autograded. Failure to adhere to the following
may result in a score as low as 0.


 - You must not comment out or edit the @htdd tag.

 - You must not comment out or delete the @dd-template-rules tag

 - Your @dd-template-rules and cond question-answer pairs MUST BE IN THE SAME
   ORDER AS THE TYPE COMMENT.

 - You must not comment out the fn-for-foo function definition.

 - Your submission must pass the Check Syntax button without any errors.

 - You should only edit the @dd-template-rules and template function definition.
   You must not edit any other parts of the file.
